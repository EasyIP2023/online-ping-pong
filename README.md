# Online Ping Ping

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](#license)

This is an online ping pong game written in C for my Graduate Operating Systems course at the University of Texas at San Antonio. No I am not using [lucurious](https://github.com/EasyIP2023/lucurious) or [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) as I am still learning Vulkan and still writing lucurious. Plus I read that SDL is a simple to learn and use API.

## Dependencies
* SDL2

```
git clone https://github.com/EasyIP2023/online-ping-pong.git
